Title of the Project:
Snapp - Smart Nutrition App

Deskripsi :
This Smart Nutrition App project focuses on nutrition scanning and data visualization in the form of graphs to help users understand their nutritional intake, especially for children to avoid unhealthy eating patterns. The problem statement raised is the need for a practical tool that can help users, especially children, identify and track the nutritional content in their daily meals quickly and accurately. The app scans food nutrition information and displays easy-to-understand graphs, providing a comprehensive overview of the user's diet and helping children and parents choose healthier foods. Our main research question was: How can this nutrition scanning-based app increase the awareness of users, especially children, about the quality of nutrition consumed and prevent the consumption of unhealthy food? The background of this project is the increasing public concern for health and balanced diets, especially for children who are prone to unhealthy diets. Our team wanted to address this issue as we saw great potential in scanning technology to raise nutrition awareness early on. By providing easy access to nutritional information, the app is expected to help users make better decisions regarding their daily nutritional intake and form healthy eating habits at a young age.
